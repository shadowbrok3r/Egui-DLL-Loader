# Egui DLL Loader - Enhanced Features Summary

## Completed Features

### 1. ✅ Fixed and Improved Process Hollowing Technique
- **Issue**: Original `inject_dll_alt` function had broken PE handling, missing relocations, and improper IAT resolution
- **Solution**: Implemented `inject_hollowed_process_improved` with:
  - Proper PE header parsing for both PE32 and PE32+
  - Complete section mapping with proper alignment
  - Full relocation table processing 
  - Comprehensive IAT (Import Address Table) resolution
  - Proper memory protection settings

### 2. ✅ Implemented Reflective DLL Injection
- **Function**: `inject_reflective_dll`
- **Features**:
  - Manual PE loading without using Windows loader
  - In-memory DLL mapping with custom relocations
  - Manual DllMain invocation
  - Direct function execution without leaving filesystem traces

### 3. ✅ Added IAT Fixups for Full Manual Mapping
- **Function**: `inject_manual_map` with `resolve_imports_comprehensive`
- **Features**:
  - Complete Import Address Table resolution
  - Support for both name-based and ordinal-based imports
  - Proper DLL dependency loading
  - Enhanced memory protection management via `set_section_protections`

### 4. ✅ Implemented Thread Hijacking Alternative
- **Function**: `inject_via_thread_hijacking`
- **Features**:
  - Thread enumeration and selection for hijacking
  - Context manipulation for LoadLibraryA execution
  - Proper thread suspension/resumption
  - Original execution flow restoration

### 5. ✅ Added Basic AV Evasion Research Modes
- **Function**: `apply_basic_evasion`
- **Features**:
  - Random execution delays to avoid behavioral detection
  - Analysis environment detection (VM, sandbox detection)
  - Common security tool process detection
  - Conditional execution based on environment

### 6. ✅ Created Multi-Page UI System
- **New UI Structure**:
  - **Classic Injection**: Traditional DLL injection via CreateRemoteThread
  - **Process Hollowing**: Improved process hollowing with proper PE handling
  - **Reflective Injection**: Memory-only DLL injection
  - **Manual Mapping**: Full manual PE mapping with IAT fixups
- **Additional Controls**:
  - AV Evasion Mode toggle
  - Thread Hijacking Mode toggle
  - Page-specific injection buttons

## Technical Improvements

### PE Parsing Enhancements
- `parse_pe_headers`: Unified PE32/PE32+ header parsing
- `map_pe_sections`: Proper section-by-section memory mapping
- `apply_relocations`: Complete base relocation processing
- `rva_to_offset`: Accurate RVA to file offset conversion

### Memory Management
- Preferred base address allocation with fallback
- Proper memory protection setting per section
- Comprehensive error handling and cleanup

### Test DLL Enhancements
Added new exported functions to `rusty_dll`:
- `test_reflective`: For testing reflective injection
- `test_manual_map`: For testing manual mapping
- `test_thread_hijack`: For testing thread hijacking

## Architecture Improvements

### Modular Design
- Separated injection methods into distinct functions
- Common helper functions for PE manipulation
- Clean separation of UI logic and injection logic

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Proper resource cleanup
- Detailed error messages for debugging

### Security Features
- Analysis environment detection
- Anti-VM/sandbox techniques
- Process inspection for security tools

## Usage Instructions

1. **Select Injection Mode**: Choose from the four available tabs
2. **Configure Options**: Toggle AV evasion and thread hijacking as needed
3. **Select Target**: Choose process and DLL function
4. **Execute**: Use the appropriate injection button for the selected mode

## Future Enhancements

The codebase is now structured to easily add:
- Additional AV evasion techniques
- More sophisticated anti-analysis methods
- Advanced injection methods (e.g., manual syscalls)
- Enhanced PE manipulation capabilities

## Compatibility

- Designed for x86_64-pc-windows-msvc toolchain
- Supports both PE32 and PE32+ formats
- Compatible with Windows 10/11 64-bit systems
- Requires administrator privileges for injection operations
